2. Installation
========================================

RsInstrument is hosted on  `pypi.org <https://pypi.org/search/?q=rsinstrument>`_. You can install it with pip (for example ``pip.exe`` for Windows), or if you are using Pycharm (and you should be :-) direct in the Pycharm packet management GUI.

Option 1 - Installing with pip.exe under Windows
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
- Start the command console: ``WinKey + R``, type ``cmd`` and hit ENTER
- Change the working directory to the Python installation of your choice (adjust the user name and python version in the path):

    ``cd c:\Users\John\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Scripts``
- install RsInstrument with the command: ``pip install RsInstrument``

Option 2 - Installing in Pycharm
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
- In Pycharm Menu ``File->Settings->Project->Python Interpreter`` click on the **'+'** button on the top left. Newer Pycharm versions have ``Python Packages`` Tool Window, you can perform the same operation there.
- Type ``rsinstrument`` in the search box
- Install the version 1.53.0 or newer
- If you are behind a Proxy server, configure it in the Menu: ``File->Settings->Appearance->System Settings->HTTP Proxy``
